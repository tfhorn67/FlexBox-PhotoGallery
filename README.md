# FlexBox-PhotoGallery
I created a simple, responsive, photo gallery that uses flexbox and media queries to control reformatting of the layout.

It should drop right into the desired parent container and format according to the container width. The media query breakpoint will need to be adjusted based on image size. And, it will work best with uniform size images.
