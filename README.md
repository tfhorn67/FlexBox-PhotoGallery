# FlexBox-PhotoGallery
I created a simple, responsive, photo gallery that uses flexbox and media queries to control reformatting of the layout Also includes a jQuery overlay.

It should drop right into the desired parent container and format according to the container width. The media query breakpoint will need to be adjusted based on image-thumbnail size. And, it will work best with uniform size images. To remove/disable the jQuery overlay, simply remove the two <script> tags at the bottom of the HTML body and delete the overlay.js file.
